abstract: "The Integrated Crisis Early Warning Systems (ICEWS) data set contains a large amount of verbal as well as physical conflict actions promising an accurate representation of conflict dynamics.1 In this post, I take a closer look at the usefulness of the data set for determining interstate conflict intensities and their development over time. For this purpose, I look more closely at the available data on the interstate conflict actions between Russia and Georgia. "
